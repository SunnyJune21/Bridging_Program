# QR Code Encoder and Decoder - Project created by Sonialyc
This project consists of two Python scripts: **QR Code Encoder** and **QR Code Decoder**. These scripts allow you to encode and decode QR codes using the provided data.

## QR Code Encoder
The QR Code Encoder script enables you to generate a QR code image based on the data you provide. To encode a QR code, simply run the script, enter the data to encode when prompted, and the QR code image will be generated and displayed.

## QR Code Decoder
The QR Code Decoder script allows you to decode a QR code image. To decode a QR code, run the script and upload the QR code image file. The script will then decode the QR code and display the result.
